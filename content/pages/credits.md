Title: Website credits
Slug: credits

This website is using the latest craze in web technology - statically built html.
This means I can build this site on my local machine and push it to any web hosting provider who
can offer top quality uptime. Currently, for me, that is Github and their awesome
[pages](http://pages.github.com) offering - of course, this means I can also make use of their free
git repositories for the actual hosted content. Even to build a simple static site such as this, there are
many people to whom I would like to extend my gratitude in the form of this credits page.


The built version of this website can be found at
[https://github.com/pelson/pelson.github.io](https://github.com/pelson/pelson.github.io) while the source
can be found in a branch of the same repository at
[https://github.com/pelson/pelson.github.io/tree/source](https://github.com/pelson/pelson.github.io/tree/source).


The html is generated using the awesome [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) from markdown stored
in the aforementioned repository. On top of this, I use [Jake Vanderplas'](https://github.com/jakevdp)
excellent [liquid_tags.notebook plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/pull/21) to turn my
[IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) into the articles you see on this site.


As for the design of this site, I originally took inspiration from [Ole Martin Kristiansen's](http://www.piraja.no)
website and have combined this with my own ideas along with the use of the incredible
["Font Awesome" icons](http://fortawesome.github.io).

Thanks guys!
